## Research Skills

* **Python** Programming
  * I  wrote a software for statistical downscaling all in Python language, implementing a whole process of statistical downscaling including netCDF data I/O, predictors selection, model training, model validation, predicting and result visualization. 
  * Machine learning using Scikit-learn library.
* **Spatial data** processing and analysis using **GIS**
  * ArcGIS
  * QGIS
* **Crop growth model**, WOFOST 
  * WOFOST is a mechanistic model that simulate how crop grow and be influenced by environmental conditions. In 2014, I got involved in a study on the growth of maize in China under the stress of water shortage. My job was to modify the code so that WOFOST model can be driven by the soil moisture data instead of the precipitation data. 
* Development of location-based **smart phone App**
  * I developed a location-based Android App in 2013 as my graduation project. It was designed as an alternative to the attendance machine that the smart phone can record the user's location by the GPS module and determine whether he is within the work place.
* **System dynamics modeling** using STELLA software 
  * I built a simple global energy balance climate model with STELLA showing how the global mean surface temperature response to variation of solar insolation and cloud cover.
* Other technical skills:
  * **Database**: PostgreSQL, PostGIS, MySQL, Hive
  * **OS**: MacOS, Windows, Linux (Ubuntu)
  * **Cloud server**: AliYun
  * MS Office



## Hobbies

Playing guitar, basketball, watching movies, reading, and travel.
